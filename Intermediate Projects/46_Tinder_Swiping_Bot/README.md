> This application is a bot that will help you and save a lot of your time on Dating and searching Tinder Profiles. Everytime you choose to surf Tinder, you spend quite some time over there, more than 90mins a day for an average person and that's a lot of time for business people. To help you with this scenario, here is an automated application that will make the right swipes for you.

> For all other time you will only need to run the application


#### Please follow these steps to get your application working
> 1. Your Tinder account must be linked with your Facebook Account and you should be able to login to tinder via Facebook.

> 2. You need to set up the account by yourself because of the *Two Factor Authentication*, and for the rest of the time the bot will be taking over the swipes.
